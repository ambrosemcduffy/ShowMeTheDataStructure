LRU_CACHE:
- DataStructure - Que linked-list, and Dictorary chosen for constant time

- Time complexity - O(1)

BlockChain:
- Data Structure - Linked list for constant appending O(1)
- Time complexity worse case 0(n) for search

Huffman Coding:
- DataStructure - Tree - Chosen for left and right child flexibilty
- Time complexity - Worse case O(nlog) for DFS recursive function

Recursion File Search:
- Data Structure - recusions cleaner look
- Time complexity = Worse case O(nlog)

Active Directory :
