This project consists of using Data Structures for everyday programming Challenges.

LRU_CACHE:
- DataStructure - Queue linked-list & hashMap chosen for constant time
- Time Complexity for insertion - O(1)
- Time Complexity for Lookups - O(1)
- Space Complexity - O(n)

BlockChain:
- Data Structure - Linked list for constant time insertion
- Time complexity worse case 0(n) for search
- Space Complexity - O(n)

Huffman Coding:
- DataStructure - Tree - Chosen for left and right child flexibilty
- Time complexity - Worse case O(n) for DFS recursive function
- Time Complexity - O(n)

Recursion File Search:
- Data Structure - recursions cleaner look
- Time complexity - Worse case O(n*m)
- Space Complexity - O(n)

Active Directory :
- Data Structure - Arrays with recursive Algorithm--> Using Recursion for its simplicity and readability.
- Time complexity - Worse case O(n)
- Space Complexity - O(n)

Union Intersection
- Data Sructure Linked list
- Time Complexity - O(n)
- Space Complexity - O(n)
